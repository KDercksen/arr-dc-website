## Information for authors, reviewers and meta-reviewers

The data collection protocol for ARR-DC builds on the initiative by [Gurevych,
Kuznetsov and Dycke (2021)](/resources/). A general overview of the updated data
collection protocol for each role in the peer review process can be found
[below](#overview-of-april-2024-protocol).

The ARR-DC organization invests reasonable effort to allow reviewers and authors
to withdraw their consent and license agreement at any time. The data collection
protocol is approved by the [ACL Ethics
Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Formation_of_the_ACL_Ethics_Committee).

**Note that full consent by authors and reviewers is always required before any data is published.**

### Important changes

From April 2024 onwards, the protocol described on this page will be in place.
Below are the key novelties with respect to the pre-April 2024 protocol:

- Authors now decide on data donation during submission and can revise this
  decision throughout the reviewing process.
- Reviewers will now also be requested to donate their metadata (i.e. scores),
  in addition to the review texts.
- Meta-reviewers will be asked to sign a license agreement to donate their
  meta-reviews of a cycle. The collection of meta-reviews is a new addition to the
  protocol.

_The pre-April 2024 protocol is described in detail in [this
blogpost](https://aclrollingreview.org/datacollection) on the ARR website._

## Overview of April 2024 protocol

### For authors

Authors are requested to consent to the collection of their data at submission
time. This decision can be revised during the review process. Collected data
includes the draft paper and associated peer review texts.

Any paper is eligible for donation regardless of final decision, as long as the
authors agree.

### For reviewers

Reviewers are asked to sign a license agreement for all their reviews of an ARR
cycle for each cycle individually, or they can grant the license for all future
ARR cycles until consent is withdrawn.

The data collected includes the review texts, metadata and discussion threads.

### For meta-reviewers

Area Chairs (ACs) are asked to sign a license agreement to donate all their
meta-reviews for the ARR cycle, or they can grant the license for all future ARR
cycles until consent is withdrawn. Additionally, ACs can specify if they prefer
their meta-reviews to be included as-is or paraphrased.
